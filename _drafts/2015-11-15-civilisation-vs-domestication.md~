Wise Man's Fear. It is a fantasy novel in the series Kingkiller
Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss. I rarely read fantasy novels with my
mind looking for allegories in the background, but some works in this
genre do really display significant instances of allegory with or
without intention.

The analogy that came to my mind whilst reading that book is from the
people of Tempi, in the descriptions of the way of Lethani. When they
call themselves civilised and others - barbarians. However, what do
they mean by civilisation? Do they mean the high speed trains and
rotating doors? No they didn't. They meant advancement in the other
area of human activity. The advancement in morality, about honour.
