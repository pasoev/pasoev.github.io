Socrates and The Concept of Irony has been the turning point in
philosophy. It not only brought new views to the world, philosophy and
more, but also changed the way people see the world and thought
itself.

There is also one interesting thing to observe about irony. What has
been the effects of irony, negativity and all the legacy of Socrates?
The world has only seen new beliefs, the quantity of information in
the world has increased overwhelmingly. A man today faces an endless
ocean of information, knowledge, possibilities. If there is a struggle
to find a meaning in the world, to believe in anything it presents to
us, there is also a counter struggle to finding your way in this
immense sea of information, beliefs, ways of life.
