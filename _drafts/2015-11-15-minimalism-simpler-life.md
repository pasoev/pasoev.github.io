title: About Minimalism and Simpler Life
category: Simpler

The world today is full of good ideas. Many of them are too good to be
brought to life. They are otherwise thoroughly kind. Such ideas are
most often criticised for how difficult it would be to implement them
in the world exactly because the world has the problems that this idea
wants to solve. A very good example of such paradox is the desire that
is born in more and more people to revolt against the modern world and
to return to simpler, more minimalist life.
