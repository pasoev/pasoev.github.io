title: Training as Testing
category: "Simpler"

There is some worship of training, of improvement and living in strict
discipline. Many systems of training from present and past are
legendary for their rigorousness. One such example is Spartan
*Agoge*. It is rare that somebody argues about effectiveness of such
regimes. However, it is rarely pointed out that not all of the
exertions in such systems are directed to improvement. A lot of it is
just about filtering people out. Giving challenges to the group that
only the strongest, most fit can complete successfully - sometimes
these challenges are long enough to appear like they are some form of
training, but in the end, they might be more aimed at testing their
ability to maintain themselves on long-term goals.

A modern equivalent of this is some introductory university courses
that are given to programming students that are not only inappropriate
for beginners, but also present challenges that aren't primarily
useful for learning. One can find many university programs that start
choose to teach C or C++ as the first programming languages.
